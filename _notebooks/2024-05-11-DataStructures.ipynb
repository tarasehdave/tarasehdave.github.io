    "This Python script implements a machine learning model within a Flask environment to predict scores based on attention-related data. It begins by importing necessary libraries and sets up a Flask Blueprint for API organization, although the ‘flask_restful’ module imported remains unused. The core of the script revolves around the ‘AttentionModel’ class, which encapsulates model initialization, training, and prediction functionalities. The class employs a singleton pattern to ensure efficient memory usage and training by maintaining a single instance throughout the application’s lifecycle. The model is trained using a linear regression model and a decision tree regressor to assess feature importance. Testing functions are provided to initialize the model and evaluate its performance on theoretical attention cases, showcasing both score prediction and feature weight extraction. This structured approach demonstrates key machine learning concepts, including data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and model evaluation.\n",
