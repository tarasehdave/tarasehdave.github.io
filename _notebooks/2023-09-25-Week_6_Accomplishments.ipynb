    "I did JS Debugging. During my assigment I would look at the code and review the specific (attempted) functions, then try and solve it. Once I reviewed the code, I would put my version into ChatGPT and ask if there were any errors. I also asked ChatGPT what was wrong with the initial code to make sure I had changed the right thing.\n",

    "I am not familiar with JavaScript so before I had to debug the code I had to learn certain functions and how to write them so that I was able to figure out what was wrong with the bugged version of it. If it was Python I would have had a better chance at fixing them without researching but because it was not I had to teach myself a little before doing it. "
