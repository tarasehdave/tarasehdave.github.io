    "We are planning on making a time zone converter. The ideal layout would be a drop bar to select a time and timezone that will then calculate the times in other regions. Users can find the external time zones by hovering over an interactive map, made through JavaScript, to find other time zones. We will use libraries, like Pytz, to provide functionality for accessing and converting between different time zones.\n",
    "We will use Python to code (pull from database(s), math for time zone differences, etc.)\n",
